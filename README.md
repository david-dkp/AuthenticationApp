## Overview

![screenshot](./screenshots/home_screenshots.png)

- Where can I see your demo? Right here :D : https://authentication-app-woad.vercel.app/
- What was your experience?  
  Awesome simple app that learns you many things about security, input validation, and sessions! I really struggled to put the front-end and back-end together, being a full-stack dev is exhausting xD. My mistake here was that I was trying to do both at the SAME time. My mind was going crazy by switching between the front-end and back-end. I don't recommend doing that for efficiency. I should've first written down the endpoints, the models, then start front-end or back-end first.
- What have you learned/improved?  
I learned the concept of Next.js, the server side rendering, the caching and so on. I learned the Material UI styling system, and used some components that I found really useful.
- Your wisdom? :)

Then to start the Next app:
